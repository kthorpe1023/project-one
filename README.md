IF you have groceries but don't know what to cook
THEN you can type in the ingredients you have
THEN recipes will appear that include the ingradients you have
IF you are missing an ingredient
THEN you can search the missing ingredient in the second search
AND a modal with alternatives will poplulate
IF you are still missing ingredients
THEN you can type in your address into the map
AND the closest three grocery stores will populate
