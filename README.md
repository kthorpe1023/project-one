If you have groceries but don't know what to cook then you can type in the ingredients you have. Recipes will appear that include the ingredients you have. If you are missing an ingredient then you can search the missing ingredient in the second search and a modal with alternatives will poplulate. If you are still missing ingredients, you can type in the address of your nearest grocery store to populate on the map.
